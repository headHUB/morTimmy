# Building a 4WD Robot based on Arduino and Raspberry Pi

The goal of this project is to build a autonomous robot that can be expanded upon easily in software. The idea is to have a varietity of different sensors available from the start and build a nice looking casing around it.

## Goals

- Autonomous driving robot
- Automatic object avoidance
- Facial recognition
- Video streaming
- Audio playback, Robot voice and music
- Voice control

## Hardware details

I've purchased the following initial hardware from the british site http://www.hobbycomponents.com/. It was the only site that I could find in Europe that had alot of the required components and had a lot of positive reviews.

- 1x Ultrasonic Module HC-SR04 Distance Sensor
- 2x L298N Stepper Motor Driver Controller Board
- 1x Hobby Components Arduino Compatible R3 Mega
- 1x V2 Mega Sensor Shield for Arduino
- 1x SG90 Pan & Titl servo bracket
- 2x Towerpro SG90 Micro servo 9g
- 1x 4 Wheeled Robot Smart Car Chassis Kit DC 3v 5v 6v suitable for Arduino
- 1x 20cm Solderless Female to Female DuPont Jumper Breadboard Wires (40-Cable Pack)
