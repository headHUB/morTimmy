# TODO LIST FOR ARDUINO CONTROLLER

- Find a suitable CLI compiler for aruino that runs on the Raspberry Pi
  - The official can be used from https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/blob/ide-1.5.x/build/shared/manpage.adoc
  - http://inotool.org/ is another one that seems to be nice
- Find a vim plugin for Arduino syntax highlighting
- Program the shizzle out of the Arduino!
