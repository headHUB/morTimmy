#ARDUINO MEGA HARDWARE CONTROLLER FOR morTimmy the Robot

This is the code that will power the low level features of morTimmy the Robot. We will be using an Arduino Mega board to control various sensors, DC motors and Servo's. It will utilise a serial interface to communicate with the Raspberry Pi which will be responsible for handling the main program logic. The intention is to use OOB best practices to create a flexible programming environment.
