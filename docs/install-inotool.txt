inotools allow you to compile and Arduino code. Here's a quick rundown on how to install it on a Raspberry Pi:

  sudo apt-get install python-configobj python-setuptools git python-jinja2 python-serial picocom

clone ino from github:

  mkdir ~/development/arduino
  cd ~/arduino/
  git clone git://github.com/amperka/ino.git

  cd ino
   (sudo or su)
    make install

Sometimes ino does not like the version string provided, cat the file  /usr/share/arduino/lib/version.txt , it should look something like  1:1.0.5+dfsg2-1
, backup the file and leave just  1.0.5.

Here's a sample of my .inorc file:

~/.inorc:

  [build]
  board-model = ATMega

  [upload]
  board-model = ATMega
  serial-port = /dev/ttyACM0

  [serial]
  serial-port = /dev/ttyACM0
